            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control, often referred to as revision control or source control is the management of changes to documents, large web sites, computer programs,and other collections of info. Changes are recorded as a number or letter code. This is known as the “revision number” or the “revision level”. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person that is making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and merged (with only some types of files). Version control systems (VCS) are most commonly ran as stand alone applications. Version control is often embedded in different softwares such as word, spreadsheets, and web docs. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A software repository is a storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed on a computer. A lot of software publishers and other organizations maintain servers on the internet for this purpose. Repositories could be just for particular programs such as CPAN and the Perl programming language, or for an entire operating system. Many Linux distributions use advanced packaging tools. Repositories usually provide a packet management system , such as tools intended to search for, install and otherwise manipulate software packages from the repositories. Software repositories are designed so that they include useful packages, major repositories are designed to be malware free.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is used for software development. Git is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support. Every Git directory on every computer there is a full fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, it’s independent of network access or a central server. Just like the Linux kernel, Git is a free software that is distributed under the terms of the General Public License. Git was created by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux kernel in 2005. Linus wanted a distributed system that he could use like ButKeeper but none met his needs so he just created his own.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud computing is a type of internet based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It provides on demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as computer networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. This storage solutions provide user enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third party data centers that could be as far away as on the other side of the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy to scan, similar to a electricity grid over an electricity network.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Working Directory</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A working directory of a process is a directory of hierarchical file system that is dynamically associated with each process. IT can sometimes be called the current working directory (CWD). In most computer file systems every directory had an entry, which was usually named “.”, which points directly to the directory. In most programming languages, an interface to the file system functions of the operating system is provided. This includes the ability to change the working directory of that program. Unlike the Windows API or POSIX C function, neither the Java programming language or the Java Virtual Machine supports the POSIX function, chdir(). </p>
